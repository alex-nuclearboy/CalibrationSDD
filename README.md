# Energy Calibration of SDDs

This repository contains the code used in the energy calibration of Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) in the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/ac7fc0">SIDDHARTA-2 experiment</a> for high-precision X-ray spectroscopy measurements of kaonic atoms. 

The SDDs are placed around a cryogenic target cell made of high purity aluminum structure and 75 µm thick Kapton walls. 
The <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/ac95da">energy calibration</a> of the SDDs is performed using two X-ray tubes installed on two sides of the vacuum chamber and a multi-element target made of high purity titanium and copper strips placed on the target cell walls. The X-ray tubes induce the fluorescence emission of the target elements, and the characteristic Kα and Kβ transitions are detected by the SDDs. 

The energy response function of the detector is predominantly a Gaussian curve for every fluorescence X-ray peak. However, the response also has a low-energy component due to incomplete charge collection and electron-hole recombination. 
Thus, the total peak fit function is formed by two contributions: Gauss function (the main contribution to the peak shape) and tail function (an exponential function to reproduce the incomplete charge collection).

Only the Ti Kα and Cu Kα peaks are used to calibrate the detectors, as they have the highest signal-to-background ratio.
